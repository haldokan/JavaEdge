 * You are given an array of distinct numbers. You need to return an index to a "local minimum" element, which is defined
 * as an element that is smaller than both its adjacent elements. In the case of the array edges, the condition is reduced
 * to one adjacent element.
 * Reach a solution with better time complexity than the trivial solution of O(n).
 * <p>
 * If there are multiple "local minimums", returning any one of them is fine.
