 * My solution to an Amazon interview question - this is practically the same Google interview question that I
 * solved here in this repo: org.haldokan.edge.interviewquest.google.OverlappingRangesStorageAndQuery
 * <p>
 * There are discounts on particular time period
 * suppost
 * Day1 - Day5 => 10%
 * Day2 - Day8 => 5%
 * Day4 - Day6 => 20 %
 * <p>
 * find the period where maximum discounts is available.
 * <p>
 * For above example the period is Day4 - Day5 => 10+5+20
 * <p>
 * that means 35%
 * <p>
 * Provide the generalize solution. Period can be time also.
