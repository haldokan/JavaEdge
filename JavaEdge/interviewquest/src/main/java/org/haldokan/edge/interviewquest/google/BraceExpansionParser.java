/**
 * TODO: provide a solution later?
 * This is similar (though simpler) to the Facebook interview question that I provide a solution for here:
 * EvaluateVarInLinearEquation.java
 *
 * Write code that would parse an expression that is similar to BASH brace expansion. Best illustrated with an example:
 * the expression "(a,b,cy)n,m" would be parsed into an array of the following strings:
 * an
 * bn
 * cyn
 * m
 * <p>
 * You can assume that the input will always be valid.
 * <p>
 * Hint: the expression can nest. Therefore, "((a,b)o(m,n)p,b)" parses into:
 * aomp
 * aonp
 * bomp
 * bonp
 * b
