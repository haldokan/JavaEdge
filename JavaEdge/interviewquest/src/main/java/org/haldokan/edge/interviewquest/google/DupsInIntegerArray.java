/**
 * My solution to a Google interview question
 * 
 * 
 * Find the duplicate in an array of length n. The values are positive integers in the range between 1 .. n-1.
 * 
 * The way I understand the is question is that all numbers in the range must be present. Since the range in 1 to n -1 there will
 * always be an exactly one dup to fill the array of length n.
