 * Here is a question from the "Cracking The Coding Interview" book with a twist.
 *
 * Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of repeated characters. (p. 73 5th edition)
 *
 * The twist: the string can also contain digits. Think of encoding and decode protocol. How the compression can be
 * reversed properly?
 *
 * For example, ab2ccccd -> ab24cd
 *
 * 07/15/20
