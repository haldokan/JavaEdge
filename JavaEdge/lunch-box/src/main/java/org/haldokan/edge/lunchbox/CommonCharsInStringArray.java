/**
 * My solution to a Linkedin-interview-question
 * 
 * Write a program that gives count of common characters presented in an array of strings..(or array of character
 * arrays)
 * 
 * For eg.. for the following input strings..
 * 
 * aghkafgklt dfghako qwemnaarkf
 * 
 * The output should be 3. because the characters a, f and k are present in all 3 strings.
 * 
 * Note: The input strings contains only lower case alphabets
