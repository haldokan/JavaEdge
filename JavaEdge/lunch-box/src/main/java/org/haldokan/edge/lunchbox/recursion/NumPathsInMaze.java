/**
 * ðŸ§© Problem Concept: Count Paths in a Maze
 * ðŸŽ¯ Goal:
 * You're given a grid or matrix (typically m x n in size). You need to determine how many distinct paths exist from the
 * top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner, by moving only in certain directions (usually right and down).
 *
 * ðŸ§  Rules & Constraints:
 * Allowed moves: Typically right and down only (not diagonal or back).
 * No obstacles: Basic version assumes an open grid.
 * Count only complete paths that reach the bottom-right corner.
 * The number of steps in each path equals (rows - 1) + (cols - 1).
