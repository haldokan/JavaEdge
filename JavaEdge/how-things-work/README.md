In order to appreciate the issues in designing algorithms and using data structures I re-implementation:

concurrent hash map with multiple hash spaces, using open addressing for handling collisions

Bitwise hashing functions

Executor service

Listenable future (a la Guava)

Latch

Detecting trends during a sliding window (a la Twitter trending)

Simulation of event loops (in progress).
