Dynamic programming solves a class of problems that are of exponentials complexity with recursion. I present here 2 examples based on 
algorithms and C implementations that Steven S. Skiena presented in his book Algorithm Design Manual.

Approximate string matching

Dynamic Fibonacci

The module also includes 2 problems that are solved using backtracking (has nothing to do with dynamic programming in fact)

Enumerate all subsets of a set (2 * pow(n))

Enumerate permutations (n!).
