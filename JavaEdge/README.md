The purpose of the Java code in this module is to present and understand the issues involved in designing algorithms. Some code is 
Just learning libs and apis by example.

Rough run-down:
   
Graph algorithms: implementations of classic graph algorithms

How things work: has some interesting re-implementations of Java/guava/etc constructs: Executor service, 
                 listenable futures, concurrent hash map, sliding window, latch, etc. They are meant as exercises
                 to appreciate the issues thus they lack many of the functionality provided by the standard work.

Search and sort: implementations of BSTs, merge/quick sort, approximate string matching, etc.

Bitwise: implementations of hash functions, checksum, bit arrays, etc.

Dynamic programming: approximate string matching, dynamic fibonacci, some backtracking algorithms, etc.

Guava: examples of using the different data structures and concurrency constructs.

Hibernate validator: detailed usage examples

Lunch box: implementation of various problems, equilibrium points and longest stretches in arrays, etc.

Java8: Display by example some Java8 features.
